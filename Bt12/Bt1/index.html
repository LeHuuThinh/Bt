        <h2>Low and Slow</h2>
        
        <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called sous vide. </br> In <span>sous vide</span> cooking, you <dfn>submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)</dfn> into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. </br> In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
        
        <p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. </br> To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time>November 30</time> .</p>
